# ios-qe-tech-test

Welcome to the Team RH Technical Test!

Thank you for taking the time out of your day for the initial interview, and we appreciate you putting together this short take-home test. For this tech-test, we have created a sample app along with XCTest and XCUITest. 
That content is a list of Xcode shortcuts, the data is stored in a local json file so it's not dynamic i.e. safe to make assertions on. All elements should have accessibility IDs associated with them so it's easier to identify the elements and write stable tests. 

Task: 
Write 2-3 XCUITests for the Shortcut app. Feel free to select the scenario of your choice. 

Once completed please share your project on Github with Suman Bala, Lead QE (suman.bala@teamrhfitness.com) or Ryan Leake, Lead iOS Dev (ryan.leake@teamrhfitness.com) along with a README that contains a brief description of your implementation and what you would like to have added if you had more time.

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you need any clarification on the test. Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
